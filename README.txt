The Project
  The aim is to develop a cheap open source Radon Monitor able to detecct alpha particles from Radon and its doughters. 
  The system can be used paired with a MCU chip (Microcontrollers, such as Arduino) to take the readings or used with a 
  standard MCA (Multi Channel Analyzer) and a 5V to 12V amplifier to precisely analyze the alpha spectre with professional 
  instrumentation.


Shemetics
  The schematis are avaiable in MULTISIM format or as Gerber files ready to be printed.
  
BOM
  The folder "BOM" contain the list with costs of the components.

Code
  The folder "Code" contains the code used for the system, for arduino or other MCU. It is avaiable also a compotuer dataloggher 
  written in python.
